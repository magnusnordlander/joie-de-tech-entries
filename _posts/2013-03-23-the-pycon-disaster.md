*I feel no need to give names here. You probably already know the names anyway, but it's not pertinent.*

I wasn't going to write this post. I do realize that by publishing it, I am just making things worse, but I argue that since my blog is not well visited the damage is minor. I still want to get this off my mind.

So, everyone following the tech industry probably knows what happened. An attendee (*"the jokester"*) made a bad joke in poor taste at PyCon. Another attendee (*"the attendee speaking up"*) took a picture, and posted it online, while also calling the incident to the staff's attention.

The infamous joke was about "big dongles", and there had been previous talk about forking. To me, the joke wasn't particularily offensive, but it **WAS** unprofessional and against the PyCon Code of Conduct. Calling it to the attention of the staff was entirely appropriate, and the staff handled the incident well. The jokester apologized, and was basically let off with a warning.

Sadly, that wasn't the end of it, presumably due to the posting of the jokester's (and other attendees') picture on Twitter. For the record, I believe that this response was inappropriate and out of proportion.

What happened next isn't really clear. People were enraged, both by the joke, the attendee speaking up and the manner in which it was done. The jokester was fired for reasons undisclosed, but presumed to relate to the joke and the following outrage.

That's when all hell started to break loose. Companies were DDOSed. People started receiving death threats or rape threats. Lots of them. And not just people directly involved, but people simply having an opinion on the matter. When we all thought this was about to blow over, the attendee speaking up was also let go, adding new fuel to the fire.

**What the fuck?**

Since when is it even *REMOTELY* okay to start sending people death threats, or rape threats or threats of any form of harm? What the hell happened to resolving conflicts like adults? Sure, mistakes were made, and people even lost their jobs because of them, but *death threats*? What's wrong with people?

Of course, there is another angle into this. The jokester was male, and the attendee speaking up was female. Most of the people getting flak (certainly rape threats) over this are women. Not because women are the only people who wants an inclusive work environment, because they're not, but in all likelyhood simply because they are women who dare speaking up.

This is fucked up. If you want to critizise the attendee speaking up, or feminism in either tech or society in general, feel free to do so. But do so in a civilized manner. Have a discussion like a normal adult, instead of lashing out like a 12-year-old.
