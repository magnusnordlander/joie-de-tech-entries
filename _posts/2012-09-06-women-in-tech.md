title: Women in tech
---

I want to start off by saying that I'm not quite sure that I'm the right person to write about this issue. The issue being the situation for, and lack of women in many fields of technology. I don't define myself as a feminist (I am however an ardent supporter of gender equality). I'm not a woman. I don't even belong to any kind of disfavored minority; I'm a straight male in the tech industry.

My opinions on the matter have been perfectly clear for many years: the tech industry in general, and IT in particular is losing out on a lot of talent and is generally worse off because of the oftentimes hostile environment towards women.

What I've come to realize lately, by debating this issue is that this is an issue that I care very deeply about, but I don't know what I can do about it. This entry is one attempt to do something about it, even though I admit that it feels kind of futile, seeing as this blog has quite few readers.

### Formulating the problem

**Let me just start by formulating the problem,** and let me do it in small anecdotes. I'm a bit thin on numbers to back me up, but they're not really necessary for the points that I'll be trying to make. Let me also remind you that my experiences are mostly from IT. Perhaps things are different in other parts of the tech industry?

Back in '05 I started studying at Linköping University, at the Computer Science and Engineering program. Out of 100 people accepted to the program, 4 were women (I think… The actual numbers might be off, but the proportions are correct). And this was just 7 years ago.

I went to Symfony Live this summer. In my estimate, less than 5% of the attendees were women, and I also had a similar experience at SymfonyDay 2011. Anecdotal evidence from multiple sources[^1] suggest that women at tech conferences are at risk for groping, sexual assault and harassment, and other vile and completely unacceptable practices. There are plenty of reports of speakers at tech conferences using pornographic or heavily sexualized imagery in presentations, or making sex jokes, assuming an audience consisting exclusively of straight males et c. I think this is signs of a endemic culture that aspires to cater exclusively to men in much of the tech industry. 

I do want to make one thing perfectly clear, I am in no way calling out Symfony Live or SymfonyDay. I have not seen, nor heard anything even suggesting that this kind of foul behavior goes on at Symfony Live or SymfonyDay. I had a great time at both conferences, they were very inspirational and I learned a lot. I just feel that it's sad (but also indicative of a problem with both the tech industry in general and tech conferences in general) that so few women chose to take part of it.

I'm very much involved in our local Symfony user group (I am the chairman actually), and at our activities there have been no women at all. None. I've been to quite a  few CocoaHeads meetups, and while the situation is better there, it's >90% men. As the chairman of our local user group, I'm in a position to try to do things about it, but I just don't know what to do[^2]. My current analysis is that there simply are *very* few women Symfony developers in the Stockholm region, and very few  women developers not currently using Symfony but who might be interested in learning more about it.

**In short, my analysis** (which isn't very well backed up by the rest of this section, I know) is that there is a societal pressure for women to not enter the fields technology in general, and IT in particular for their career, and that the only women who do have a particularily strong interest in technology.

Society expects men to be interested in technology, and raises boys with that expectation. This means that even though not every man is extraordinarily skilled, they still feel that they can participate in the tech community, and find it easier to grow their skills.

In my opinion, this means creates an unhealthy frat-house culture, which just serves to push women out.

### What can we do about it?

I could speak all day about what "we the people" could do. We could get more girls and young women interested in technology, we could encourage them to grow their skills.  We could reform the schools, to be more encouraging. As a society, we could change our expectations of women et c.

Sadly, I don't have the power to do that. I'm just one guy, and I assume that you, dear reader; are too[^3]. 

I don't have all the answers here. But I do know something that both you and I can do: **Don't be a creep, don't be a jerk and don't act like a frat boy.**

I know this might not be easy. This is after all the culture in which we work, and people get set in their ways, manners and figures of speech, but this is not optional. Seriously.

Don't assume that women at tech meetups are someone's girlfriend, or that they're less skilled than the men in attendance. Also, they're not there because they're looking for a date, they're there for the same reason you are, to have fun, learn and to participate in the community, and you're an ass if you're ruining that for them. Don't make sexist jokes or comments, and don't encourage at other people's sexist jokes or comments.

Really, just show some respect. Preferably exactly the same respect you'd show a man.

*Hopefully, this is not news to you.* But sadly, I'm sure it's news to some people. I'm also sure that some people are thinking that I (or people who think like me, because those people probably not reading my blog) should go fuck myself for saying this, and that they don't care about this issue. I'd kindly ask those people to either reconsider or to fuck off. Their choice.

Furthermore I don't think we can stop there. I think we need to do more. Some of those "we the people" thing I wrote above would be nice. I don't know how or what, but we have to do *something*.
