Hi-ya buddy!

Cool!

Aw, shucks!

Okay. Looks nice. Kinda worried about the 'e-mails from watched repos thing'.

Um... Okay... So... I'm watching a bunch of repos because I think they look cool. I don't really want to... you know... get e-mails from them.

But... What about the cool repos? I don't want to unwatch them? How should I keep track of the cool stuff I find on GitHub if I have to unwatch them? Do I need to start using some kind of link collection service? Or bookmarks? I'm getting worried.

To quote the immortal Zapp Brannigan: "Stop testing our love!"

Well... You could have told me earlier. Like, before you started going on about un-watching repos and before I made a fool of myself. But okay, I forgive you. Just don't let it happen again, okay?
